# What is YATTIE?

YATTIE is a tool designed to help testers test.

More specifically, the authors were looking for an extensible, open tool to replace the hodgepodge of utilities used during scripted and exploratory testing sessions.

The tooling they found readily available was either:

* Not up to the task
* Locked into a walled garden
* Not under active development
* Closed or not extensible for additional needs

Or, most often, some dreadful combination of the four!

Thus, YATTIE was born.

Designed with the testing community in mind, YATTIE is open, free, and available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Overview

Traditionally, the script and exploratory testers' tool belt has consisted of a wide variety of purpose-built utilities with a single focus and (often) zero integration.  While tools that do one thing well are nothing to look down upon, the overhead of managing said tools can often distract from the testing effort - interrupting flow, natural discovery and fun!

YATTIE strives to streamline this by providing an easy-access Swiss Army knife for the tester in the flow.  From evidence gather to note taking and analysis, YATTIE strives to keep everything in one easily referenceable and exportable location.

As a tool focused primarily on exploration and discovery, YATTIE tries not to be prescriptive on workflow or process.  Instead, it provides the tools necessary to conduct freeform exploration with the option for users to configure more structure as desired.
