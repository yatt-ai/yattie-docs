# Quickstart

{% hint style="info" %}
**Dual purpose:** In addition to more formal testing sessions, YATTIE is great for grabbing some quick evidence to share with your colleagues.  This section walks you through the fastest way to start testing.
{% endhint %}

The fastest way to get started testing is to do so without any external connections or the structure of a full exploratory session.

Once you open the app you can choose "Quick Test" to move into the testing workspace.

You will be prompted to choose which screen or application you'd like to record and gather evidence from.  Once you've selected your screen, the session will automatically start recording.

Now you should be in the testing workspace.

<div data-full-width="false">

</div>

The buttons along the bottom are for managing the testing session and gathering evidence.

**Session control buttons:**

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="" data-size="original"> Stops the test session.

**Evidence gathering buttons:**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>) Begins and ends recording the selected screen/application.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>) Takes a screenshot of the selected screen/application.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>) Begins and ends recording audio.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png) Add a note (Comment, Problem, Suggestion, Idea, Question, Concern, Positive).

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>) Create a mind map.

![](../.gitbook/assets/icon\_minimize.png) Minimize to focus on your selected screen. Maximize at the top right to bring back.

![](../.gitbook/assets/icon\_more.png) Click for additional menu items: Change recording target

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-07-29 at 4.51.59 PM.png>) Create a new Issue (when logged in with an issue tracker such as Jira)



Once you have finished collecting evidence, you can click the "Stop" button which prompts you to summarize your test session with a comment.

<div data-full-width="false">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/quicktest_summary.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Once saved, you are taken to the full test summary screen. The right-hand column is of particular interest on this screen, as it contains all of the evidence gained in chronological order.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/4-quickstart-test-summary-evidence-column.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this column, you can selected evidence to be exported (there are checkboxes on the right hand side).  Once you have selected the evidence you are interested in, you can click the "Export" button and choose where to save the zipped evidence.

You can then find the evidence wherever you saved it - zipped up in a ZIP archive and ready to share!
